# Node Practice

This is a project that will eventually contain multiple small apps that I am developing for the purpose of learning Node.

## Apps

* **expense-calc**: this is a console app that reads data from a file and prints output to another file. To run: `node expense-calc <csv-input-file>`
  * Sample input file: `expenses.csv`
* **resume-api**: a simple rest api that allows a user to access information from my resume. To run: `node resume-api`. Has the following endpoints:
  * `/`
  * `/education`
  * `/experience`
  * `/knowledgeandskills`

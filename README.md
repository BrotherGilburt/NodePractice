# Node Practice

This is a project that will eventually contain multiple small apps that I am developing for the purpose of learning Node.

## Apps

* **ExpenseCalc**: this is a console app that reads data from a file and prints output to another file. To run: `node ExpenseCalc <inputfile>`
  * Sample input file: expenses.csv
* ...More to come.
